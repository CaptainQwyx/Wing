<h4>Why is this needed?</h4>
<p>
    Some actions on our site require additional authentication to make your data more secure.
    This way we are sure that data such as your password, address, etc are not ever displayed
    to anyone but you.

<p>If you did not request this verification, you should probably change your password.</p>

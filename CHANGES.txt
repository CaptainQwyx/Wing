----------------------------------------------------------
This file tracks the changes to Wing over time. Especially
with respect to new features and compatibility changes.
==========================================================

2014-02-27
 * You can now make a class viewable using the PrivilegeControlled role.

2013-10-30
 * Changed session to compare the password hash stored in the session with the one stored in the database. This way all existing sessions will get logged out if the user changes their password. 

2013-09-25
 * Daemonized wingman.pl. You now need the Daemon::Control perl module. You can also add a "wingman/pid_file_path" directive to your config file if you want to control where the pid is stored. 
 * Added --watch-only as a command line flag to wingman.pl so that you can specify a tube to watch other than the default tube. This is useful when you have different servers that you wish to handle different tubes. 

2013-09-21
 * Fixed a major security hole where it was possible to create new objects in some cases when you shouldn't be able to.

2013-09-03
 * Wing::Role::Result::Field now allows you to pass a code reference into the options parameter so you can dynamically generate field options.

2013-08-12
 * Wing tenant sites now need a new configuration entry tenants/app_dir to tell Wing where to find the APP_DIR for tenants.  This allows the owner codebase to find it for doing database installs and library path handling.
 * Wing tenant sites have a limited SSO to use their owner's sites to log into tenant sites.

2013-08-08
 * Wing::Rest now has generate_relationship() and generate_all_relationships() so that
	you need not hand-create your relationship web services any longer. These are
	also enabled by default when you 'wing class --add=NewClass'

2013-06-18
 * Wing::Rest::Status now returns a tracer for checking cookie values.

2013-06-08

2013-05-19

 * WARNING: By this point all Wing apps should have a block similar 
	to this added to their config files if they want to start
	using Wingman services.

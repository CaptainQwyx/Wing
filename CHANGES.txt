2015-04-09
 * Added "email_override" option to the config file. If this is specified then any emails sent out will always go to that address rather than the intented recipient.

2015-03-31
 * A massive overhaul to wing.angular.js:
 * Refactored objectListManager factory to be smaller and more flexible.
 * Moved confirmations from objectListManager into it's own factory.
 * Added objectManager factory and made objectListManager use objectManager objects.
 * Added directive for input[number] to force the model to always be a number.
 * Added autosave directive which works similar to wing.attach_autosave()
 * Added wing-select directive, which autogenerates <select> lists from _options data.
 * Added force-string directive, which forces numbers to be strings for display purposes on a model. This is needed because Perl hash keys aare always strings, but scalars can be strings or numbers, so when comparing them in js 1 != '1'. 

2015-03-29
 * Added wing.merge() to wing.js, which is useful for merging parameter hashes to make a request back to the server.
 * Added wing.angular.js. To use it simply do:

  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.8/angular.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/wing.angular.js"></script>

  myApp = angular.module('MyApp',['wing']);

  myApp.controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $http, objectListManager) {
    $scope.users = new objectListManager(
        fetch_options : {
            _include_options: 1,
            _include_relationships: 1, // required
        },
        list_api : '/api/user',
        create_api : '/api/user',
        on_create : function(object, index) {
            wing.success(object.username + ' created.');
        },
        on_update : function(object, index) {
            wing.success(object.username + ' saved.');
        },
        on_delete : function(object, index) {
            wing.success('Deleted' + object.name +'.');
        },
    });
  });

  <!-- in html -->
  <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
    <div ng-repeat="user in users.objects">{{user.properties.username}} <button ng-click="user.delete()">Delete</button></div>
  </div>


2015-03-12
 * Fixed a bug where 0 didn't count as a defined value for required fields.
 * Rebuilt the "wing class" command so that it more accurately reflects modern Wing development practices.
 * wing.js added a callback parameter to wing.delete_object().

2015-03-10
 * Fixed a bug where the default web.psgi and rest.psgi files were missing "use Dancer;" which caused everything to fail.
 * Did a lot of cleanup of the default templates to more modern practices.
 * Rewrote the user manager app to use AngularJS instead of Handlebars
 * wing.js added wing.angular_http_injector() which you can use like this:

  app.config( function($httpProvider) {
    $httpProvider.defaults.withCredentials = true;
    $httpProvider.interceptors.push(wing.angular_http_interceptor);
  });

 * wing.js added wing.angular_datetime_filter() which you can use like this:

  app.filter('datetime', ['$filter', wing.angular_datetime_filter]);

2014-12-30
 * wing.js update_field() now passes the data result to the callback.
 * wing.js attach_autosave() now allows a third parameter to be a callback that will be executed upon success.

2014-09-21
 * Now have a default Result Set object which is required for Wing to operate. This is a backward incompatible change, but is easily fixed. Simply edit YourApp::DB and add this line inside load_namespaces()

  __PACKAGE__->load_namespaces(
      default_resultset_class => '+Wing::DB::ResultSet',
  );

2014-09-20
 * Switched to PNotify 2.0. This is backward incompatible with PNotify 1.0.

2014-05-27
 * Add error handling to SendTemplateEmail Wingman job.

2014-05-06
 * Add a file to hold a master before_template_render hook for all of wing.  This hook should always be the last hook processed, because it will call describe on the current_user object passed in.

2014-04-2
 * Automatically set the database name in the config file, based on the project name.

2014-03-17
 * Update the template class templates for Bootstrap3

2014-02-27
 * You can now add extra_processing to the Wing::Rest's generate_delete.

2014-02-27
 * You can now make a class viewable using the PrivilegeControlled role.

2013-10-30
 * Changed session to compare the password hash stored in the session with the one stored in the database. This way all existing sessions will get logged out if the user changes their password. 

2013-09-25
 * Daemonized wingman.pl. You now need the Daemon::Control perl module. You can also add a "wingman/pid_file_path" directive to your config file if you want to control where the pid is stored. 
 * Added --watch-only as a command line flag to wingman.pl so that you can specify a tube to watch other than the default tube. This is useful when you have different servers that you wish to handle different tubes. 

2013-09-21
 * Fixed a major security hole where it was possible to create new objects in some cases when you shouldn't be able to.

2013-09-03
 * Wing::Role::Result::Field now allows you to pass a code reference into the options parameter so you can dynamically generate field options.

2013-08-12
 * Wing tenant sites now need a new configuration entry tenants/app_dir to tell Wing where to find the APP_DIR for tenants.  This allows the owner codebase to find it for doing database installs and library path handling.
 * Wing tenant sites have a limited SSO to use their owner's sites to log into tenant sites.

2013-08-08
 * Wing::Rest now has generate_relationship() and generate_all_relationships() so that
	you need not hand-create your relationship web services any longer. These are
	also enabled by default when you 'wing class --add=NewClass'

2013-06-18
 * Wing::Rest::Status now returns a tracer for checking cookie values.

2013-06-08

 * Converted wing_add_class.pl and wing_template_class.pl to Wing Command.

2013-05-19
 * Added EmailAllAdmins Wingman plugin.
 * WARNING: By this point all Wing apps should have a block similar 
	to this added to their config files if they want to start
	using Wingman services.

    "wingman" : {
        "max_workers" : 2,
        "beanstalkd" : {
           "server" : "127.0.0.1",
           "ttr" : 60,

        },

                "phase" : "SendTemplatedEmail",
           },
           "Wingman::Plugin::EmailAllAdmins" : {
                "phase" : "EmailAllAdmins",
